# Weather-Timeline-Project

This is a simple and interactive Weather Timeline web application that displays weather information based on city name, date, and time. The project visually presents weather conditions in a timeline format, making it easy to track how the weather changes over time for a specific location.

Users can view details such as:

📍 City name
📅 Date and time
🌦️ Weather conditions for that location

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a clean UI, responsive design, and dynamic data handling. This project helped strengthen my understanding , styling layouts, and working with time-based data in JavaScript.
